        <h1>How Victor's Calendar Program! Works</h1>

<b>Installation and Setup</b>

<p>Installing the Victor's Calendar Program! extension from the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/victors-calendar-program/gofnfldobelkmnigplecijioboppgpbf" target="_blank">Google Chrome Web Store</a>, 
puts the necessary code on your computer to enable the extension. To get started, simply click on the icon, then "Click here if below is blank" to initiate the sign-in process.
</p>
<b>Sign-In and Authorization</b>

<p>The extension uses a secure sign-in process known as  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth" target="_blank">OAuth2 authorization</a>, 
which is a widely accepted standard for 
safely granting applications like ours access to your Google Calendar without needing your Google password.</p>

<b>No Data Transmission to Developers</b>

<p>It's important to note that the sign-in process is entirely private â€” <b>no personal data is transmitted to us, 
the developers, nor is any data stored other than on your local machine.</b></p>

<b>Accessing Calendar Events</b>

<p>Once signed in, the extension checks for today's and tomorrow's events in your Google Calendar, as well as any 
events containing the keywords "Doctor," "Dr.," "Appointment," "Appt," or "Birthday." Found events are then neatly 
displayed in the sidebar of your Chrome browser.
</p>
<b>Privacy and Local Processing</b>

<p>We respect your privacy: all data processing happens on your computer, and <b>no calendar data is transmitted to or 
stored by the extension</b>. Your calendar details remain confidential and are only used to provide you with the 
highlights within the sidebar.</p>

<b>Easy Access to Your Schedule</b>

<p>By utilizing Victor's Calendar Program!, you can easily keep track of important events without the need to navigate 
away from your current browser page, ensuring you stay organized effortlessly. </p>

<b>Why did you make this?</b>

<p>I made it for my mum. I am publishing it on the Chrome Web Store publicly so that she can install it with 
    maximum ease. I put my name on it so that she won't think she has been 'hacked'
