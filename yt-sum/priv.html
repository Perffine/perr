    <b>Privacy Policy for YouTube Video Summarizer & Analyzer Extension</b>
    <br><br>

Last Updated: Aug 19 2024

<br><br>
<b>1. Introduction</b>
<br><br>

Welcome to the YouTube Video Summarizer & Analyzer Extension ("we," "our," "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled securely and responsibly. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use our Chrome extension.
<br><br>
<b>2. Information We Collect</b>

Currently, we do not collect any personal data or usage analytics from users. The extension does not track your browsing activity or collect any personal information.
<br><br>
<b>3. How We Use Your Information</b>

All queries made through the extension are processed via secure requests to external APIs, specifically:

YouTube API: To retrieve video details such as titles and durations.
Google Custom Search API: To perform searches based on generated queries related to the video content.
OpenAI API: To generate summaries and analyses of video transcripts.
Your data is transmitted securely to these APIs solely to provide the services offered by the extension. We do not store, share, or retain any of the data sent through these APIs.
<br><br>
<b>4. Future Data Collection</b>

We may, in the future, decide to collect certain analytic data to improve the extension's functionality. This could include:

Usage Analytics: Information about how often specific features are used to help us prioritize future development.
User Preferences: Feedback or survey responses regarding feature preferences and special instructions to enhance user experience.
If we decide to implement data collection, we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly and provide clear notice to users. Any data collected will be anonymized and used solely for the purpose of improving the extension.
<br><br>
<b>5. Third-Party Services</b>

As mentioned, our extension interacts with third-party services (YouTube, Google, OpenAI) to function. We ensure that these services handle your data securely, and we only transmit the necessary information required for the service to function.
<br><br>
<b>6. Your Rights</b>

Since we currently do not collect any personal data, there are no specific actions required from you regarding data access, correction, or deletion. However, if you have any concerns or questions, please feel free to contact us.
<br><br>
<b>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</b>

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify users of any significant changes by updating the date at the top of this page.
