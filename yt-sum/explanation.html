    <b>Non AI Generated Gobbledegook Info for Nerds:</b>
    <p>When user has a YouTube video with the transcript open, this will summarize, analyze bias, and provide counterpoints. Fact check and custom instructions are available. </p>

    <li>The transcript is scraped from the tab (no automated way is possible rn, currently google is blocking all ips that use these tools)</li>

    <li>The video ID is taken from the open tab, and that is sent to an AWS Lambda function which gets the video's title and duration from the YouTube Data API.</li>

    <li>The transcript is sent to the ChatGPT4o-mini API via an AWS Lambda function.</li>

    <li>ChatGPT is instructed to summarize, provide bias analysis, and return a suitable Google search query</li>

    <li>Chat's response is parsed for the query, and that query is sent to a Google custom search API via AWS Lambda function.</li>

    <li>Data is then parsed for the results tab.</li>
