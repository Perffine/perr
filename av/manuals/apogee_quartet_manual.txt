Setting Sample Rate 


Quartet operates at all standard sample rates between 44.1 kHz and 192 kHz. In most cases, the 
sample rate is set by the audio application with which Quartet is communicating. For example, when 
using Quartet with GarageBand, Quartet's sample rate is automatically set to 44.1 kHz, to match the 
GarageBand song's sample rate. For those audio applications that don't include a sample rate setting, 
such as iTunes, Quartet's sample rate may be set in Audio MIDI Setup or on the System Setup tab of

1. Device Icon & ID Button - see the description above. 
2. Analog Level - Use this menu to select mic, instrument, or line input. 


3. Soft Limit - Use this menu to engage Soft Limit. Soft Limit is Apogee’s proprietary analog process 
for taming transients before A/D conversion. By gently rounding transients in a transparent manner, 
it’s possible to maximize level BEFORE the A/D conversion stage. 

Soft Limit is most effective with signals with large transients such as drums, percussion and plucked 
instruments. Soft Limit may not be the appropriate choice for signals such as bass or organ. 

4. Input Level - The gain of each input is controlled with these software knobs. The gain level is 
indicated in the value box below the knob. 

5. Analog Input Meter - This meter displays the level of the analog input after A/D conversion. 

6. Group On/Off - Use this drop down menu to assign inputs to 1 of 2 groups. When inputs are 
assigned to a group, the adjustment of any grouped Input Level changes all Input Levels in the group. 
This is useful when recording stereo sources such as a piano. If a gain offset is present between inputs 
when a Group is assigned, this offset is preserved. 

7. Phase - Check this box to reverse the polarity of the input signal. Under certain circumstances, 
when two mics are used on one source, reversing the polarity of one mic may result in a fuller sound. 
For example, when top and bottom mic'ing a snare drum, a fuller sound is obtained when the polarity 
of the bottom mic is reversed. 

8. 48 V / Phantom Power- Engage this button for 48 volts phantom power on the XLR connections. 
Condenser mics require phantom power to operate.

2. Analog Output Meter - This meter displays the level of the analog output before D/A conversion, in 
the range -48 to 0 dBFS. 
3. Analog Out Format - This drop down menu sets the format of the analog outputs: 
Line: all six analog outputs are configured as line outputs; monitor functions such as level 
control, Mute, Dim and Sum to Mono are disengaged. 
Stereo: Outputs 1-2 are configured as speaker outputs (with all monitor functions available) 
while outputs 3-6 are configured as line outputs. 
2 Speaker Sets: Outputs 1-4 are configured as two pairs of stereo outputs. Switch between 
the stereo pairs with the Speaker Select buttons (or using the top panel Touchpads). 
3 Speaker Sets: All six outputs are configured as three pairs of stereo outputs. Switch between 
the stereo pairs with the Speaker Select buttons (or using the top panel Touchpads). 
5.1: All six outputs are configured as speakers outputs, suitable for connection to a 5.1 speaker 
system. 
4. Speaker Out Level - When Analog Out Format is set to Stereo, 2 or 3 Speaker Sets or 5.1, this knob 
controls the speaker output level. 
5. Headphone Level - This knob controls the output level of the right side headphone output. 
6. Mute - Click"M" to mute the speaker (or headphone) output. 
Quartet's top panel Touchpads may be set to engage Mute on the Speaker outputs, the headphone 
outputs or both at the same time. See Device Settings Tab Window. 
7. Dim - Click"D" (for Dim) to lower the speaker (or headphone) output level by 15 dB. This function is 
a convenient way to briefly lower the playback volume in the speakers or headphones in order to hold 
a conversation without completely muting the output. 
Quartet's top panel Touchpads may be set to engage Dim on the Speaker outputs, the headphone 
outputs or both at the same time. See Device Settings Tab Window. 
8. Sum to Mono - Click"»" to sum the left and right channels of the speaker (or headphone) outputs to 
mono. At many points of the production process, this function is useful to check mono compatibility. 
For example, when recording with a stereo pair of mics, it's always a good idea to sum both channels 


Version 1, September 2012 36 


Maestro 2 - Apogee Quartet User’s Guide 


to mono and check for unevenness in the frequency range caused by phase cancellation and 
reinforcement of particular frequencies. If the sound changes significantly or sounds "hollow" when 
summed to mono, this may indicate phase issues caused by a less than optimal mic placement. 

When mixing, it's also a good idea to check mono compatibility. Beyond questions of phase, any 
masking caused by overlapping frequencies is most easily heard when listening in mono. Try starting a 
mix with Sum to Mono engaged - once you have something that sounds good, then disengage Sum to 
Mono and revel at the beautiful stereo mix you've created! 


Quartet's top panel Touchpads may be set to engage Sum to Mono on the Speaker outputs, the 
headphone outputs or both at the same time. See Device Settings Tab Window.

Low Latency Mixing 


While recording, if you notice a delay between the moment you play or sing a note and when you hear 
it in your headphones you are experiencing latency. Maestros low latency mixer may help and can be 
configured by clicking the Mixer tab in Maestro. 


Quartet 












| Output Routing | | System Setup 


Maestro Low Latency mixing 


A bit of background information concerning latency and computer-based digital recording setups will 
help you better understand these functions. 


When recording with most computer-based digital audio applications, the delay between the input 
and output of the recording system often disturbs the timing of the musicians performing. This delay, 
known as latency, means that the musician hears the notes played a few milliseconds after having 
actually played them. As anyone who has spoken on a phone call with echo knows, relatively short 
delays can confuse the timing of any conversation, spoken or musical.

Figure A 


To illustrate the effect of latency, Figure A depicts the typical signal path of a vocal overdub session. A 
vocalist sings into a microphone, which is routed to an analog to digital converter, then to the audio 
software application for recording. In the software application, the vocalist's live signal is mixed with 
the playback of previously recorded tracks, routed to a digital to analog converter, and finally to the 
vocalist's headphones. A slight delay accumulates at each conversion stage, while a much greater 
amount of delay occurs through the software application, resulting in the vocalist hearing his 
performance in headphones delayed by several milliseconds.

Output from DAW 


Latency Latency 


By routing the hardware input directly to the hardware output and mixing in playback as shown in 
Figure B, it’s possible to provide the vocalist a headphone monitoring signal with a much shorter 
delay. 

First, the signal being recorded (in this case, a vocal mic) is split just after the A/D stage and routed to 
both the software application for recording and directly back to the hardware outputs without going 
through the latency-inducing software. This creates a low latency path from mic to headphones. Next, 
a stereo mix of playback tracks is routed to the low latency mixer and combined with the hardware 
input(s). This allows the performer to hear himself while listening to playback tracks without a 
confusing delay in order to comfortably record overdubs. 


Note that the software application’s mixer is used to set a stereo mix of playback tracks while the low 
latency mixer is used to set the balance between the stereo playback mix and the hardware inputs. 


Version 1, September 2012 47 


Maestro 2 - Apogee Quartet User’s Guide 


Working with the Maestro Mixer 


Do | need the Maestro Mixer? 


The Maestro mixer serves to provide a low latency monitoring mix while recording. Therefore if you're 


using Quartet to listen to iTunes or audio from another program, there's no need to use the mixer.. 
It's possible that the latency of your particular recording system is low enough to be unnoticed. The 
system latency is determined by the recording software's buffer setting; if your Mac is powerful 
enough, it's possible to set the buffer to a lower value (shorter latency) without encountering clicks 
and pops in the audio output. If the latency doesn't pose a problem while recording, there's no need 


to employ the low latency mixer. 


Recording software settings 


Before using the Maestro mixer, it's necessary to change a few settings in your recording software.

Version 1, September 2012 


Because the signal to be recorded is 
monitored through the Maestro mixer, 
the outputs of software tracks actively 
recording should be muted - after all, 
that's the source of the latency. Most 
software applications provide an 
option to turn off software monitoring 
of recording tracks. In Logic Pro, for 
example, the software monitoring 
option is found in the same Audio 
preferences window used to select 
Quartet as the hardware device (Logic 
Pro menu » Preferences » Audio). 
Uncheck the Software Monitoring 
box.

Playback mix 


In your recording software, set up a mix of all playback tracks and route it to the first pair of outputs. If 
a master fader controls the global output of the mix, it's suggested to set the fader to O dB.

In the Maestro Output Routing tab, route Mixer 1 (or Mixer 2) to Line 1/2. If Analog Out Format is set to 
2 or 3 Speaker Sets, route Mixer to all the analog outputs in use, as shown below.
