To Nate and Ben. Pardon this rambling middle of the night business. Fwiw, it's a super nice night in Toronto and I was thiking about anything you should know if I don't make it at my likely surgery tomorrow. The odds are super slim, but you never know. Gonna play it safe here. Not like I did with my will hiyahh .. i had claude do up a proto-will which should be here, and though it isn't signed . hm maybe i can find a printer .. it should be a good start. Pretty standard stuff. Use what money I have left and have a nice party, you guys get inhertance from life insurance (iirc $500k) when you turn 18. Obvs that's a good chunk of money, and i totally 100% trust you to be wise with it, epicly foolhearty, or something in between. Life is all about learning. You guys are so bright, even if you act stupid you are still smart. May as well accept that. Tbh .. the years before you are 25 will make you do stupid things, perhaps even sensational. I wish I was there for it. Please try not to stress out mom too mch though?
</p>
<p>
    This is going to be hella tough on mom and others. But .. keep in mind this is about you. You will support them, ofc. But be aware that boundaries are a thing, and will serve you all well. This is something I always struggled with .. I "do too much" and am "too nice" I hear it all the time. It's fine, but in this stage of life I understand that when I don't appreciate boundaries, nobody benefits. I am likely guilty of enabling bad behaviour for this.
</p>
<p>
    So my final message to you is: deep breaths. All the answers you need are there. Just keep followng that and you'll get what you need. So many applications .. there will be times when you try it, and be like "oh dang it works for this too?" I'm positive you'll have some laughs with it too. As far as long-term deep-breaths stuff, there is a saying about how it is like polishing a crusty, scratched up mirror. You just keep patiently at it, eventually you will see yourself.
</p>
<p>
    Other thoughts: if you want to get to know me better, have at my social media. You know the password on my phone. Feel free to dig in. I'm an open book. No agenda. Foolishly trusting at times. Just all about the love, enjoyment of life, enjoyment of other ppl, wrapped up in the mystery of life. Also, if you want to get to know me better, have a look at my claude.ai account. Lots of chats there that i hope you find interesting. I'm totally honest there, I think it's a fair look into my psyche. It will be embarassingly naive at times lol.
</p>
<p>
    Also feel free to have at all my creative work. I have a couple github accounts (gitupwithit and perffine) .. no obligation to finish anything. Just get claude code to finsish it all if you want. There's some music stuff floating about, not much to speak of. But may be of interest? also I started a yt called "i don't draw very well" which was supposed to get me drawing more .. I'm a terrible drawer .. and telling random stories. The one on there is something I thought was entertaining but I didn't want to tell you cuz it's a little scary and I was being stupid and naive. The next one was supposed to be about te first time i throoughly cleared the dance floor as a dj. the pics are in my bag i think, never got around to finsishing it. Oh Amogus Obby - maybe finsih the story .. basically the player has to do a night time invenory shift, counting barrels with a clunky scanner. The general is excited to be there (remotely lol) but he's old and cant stay up late. So part of the inventory shift is waking him up over and over .. until he just wont. then the player tosses his telepresence robot onto the couch, allowing the player to get the good inventory scanner, and finish the level. No pressure, but might be a good project? Again, vibe coding is the way XD.

    Just have to let you know that every interaction with you guys is a treasure for me. Hanging out and watching whatever movie? The best. Remember the Great YolkTales? Our MC server? Laser Tag? Watching Fnaf movie? But even just chatting about whatever. Ben: your insights into creative stuff are solid. Love hearing what you have to say about games, movies, etc. Nate: you have some pain. It is an unfair amount you were born with. I am sorry. I hope you continue to study it. All that time we spent on 'Mind Over Mood', and all those chats we had about philosophy - precious memories for me. If either or both of you ended up being successful as artists in some form, I would not at all be surprised. I think you both have SO MUCH to offer the world just by nature of your thoughtfulness. You know most people aren't like that eh? Like yeh there are lots of youtubers with interesting channels, but as far as regular population you both are have very uncommonly powerful mental abilties, and good hearts. 
</p>
<p>
    To Jill: Love of my life. Love ya! So many good memories. I feel blessed to have shared all the expriences we had together. Love ya!
</p>
<p>
    To the rest of my fam: thanks! For all the support and great times. You are the real ones. Please check in on Ben and Nate. This fam can have a tendency to 'drift' a little .. we are a lot of introverts, dealing with our own things, I get that. But if you want to properly remember me? Have a quick chat with Ben and Nate please.
</p>
<p>Message for all remaining randos: Nice knowing you! Keep it chllin' Now get on with your life â™¥</p>
